knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, root.dir = '~/420 - Predictive II/Aggregated Data')

## Import Data
```{r}
park_areas <- read_excel("~/420 - Predictive II/Aggregated Data/Park Areas by ZIP.xlsx")
ZIP <- read_excel("~/420 - Predictive II/Aggregated Data/ZIP to Neighborhood.xlsx")
num_of_parks <- read_excel("~/420 - Predictive II/Aggregated Data/Number of Parks by ZIP.xlsx")
liquor <- read_excel("~/420 - Predictive II/Aggregated Data/Liquor Licenses by ZIP.xlsx")
grocery <- read_excel("~/420 - Predictive II/Aggregated Data/Grocery Stores by Neighborhood.xlsx")
health <- read.csv("~/420 - Predictive II/Aggregated Data/Public_Health_Statistics-_Selected_public_health_indicators_by_Chicago_community_area.csv")
ZIPtoCA <- read_excel("~/420 - Predictive II/Aggregated Data/ZIPtoCA.xlsx")
```

## Join Health data and neighborhoods
```{r}
colnames(ZIPtoCA) <- c("ChicagoCA", "ZIPCode", "2010Pop")
health <- merge(health, ZIPtoCA, by.x = "Community.Area", by.y = "ChicagoCA")
health <- merge(health, ZIP, by.x = "ZIPCode", by.y = "Zip Code")
health <- health[ , c(1:4, 18, 5:17, 18:32)] # reorder columns

write.csv(health, file = "~/420 - Predictive II/Aggregated Data/healthWithZIPSandCAs.csv")
```

## Create full matrix of predictors
```{r}
allPreds <- health
names(allPreds)
head(allPreds)
head(grocery)

# Merge in park_areas
allPreds <- merge(allPreds, park_areas, by.x = "ZIPCode", by.y = "ZIP")

# Merge in num_of_parks
allPreds <- merge(allPreds, num_of_parks, by.x = "ZIPCode", by.y = "ZIP")

# Merge in liquor
allPreds <- merge(allPreds, liquor, by.x = "ZIPCode", by.y = "Zip Code")

# Merge in grocery
allPreds <- merge(allPreds, grocery, by.x = "Neighborhood", by.y = "Neighborhood")

# write.csv(allPreds, file = "~/420 - Predictive II/Aggregated Data/allPredictors.csv")
```

## Build linear model
```{r}
names(allPreds)
fit_lm <- lm(Diabetes.related ~ Cancer..All.Sites. + Birth.Rate + Below.Poverty.Level + NumberOfParks + LiquorLicenses + GroceryStores, data = allPreds)
summary(fit_lm)
```

## Fit nnet
```{r}

```

## Fit decision tree
